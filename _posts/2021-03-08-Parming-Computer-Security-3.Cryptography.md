## 3.0 Learning Objectives & Orientation
### Learning Objectives
-	Explain the concept of cryptography.
-	Describe symmetric key encryption and the importance of key length.
-	Explain negotiation stage.
-	Explain initial authentication, including MS-CHAP.
-	Describe keying, including public key encryption.
-	Explain how electronic signatures, including digital signatures, digital certificates, and key-hashed message authentication codes (HMACs) work.
-	Describe public key encryption for authentication.
-	Describe quantum security.
-	Explain cryptographic systems including VPNs, SSL, and IPsec

### Orientation
-	Chapter 1 introduced the threat environment.
-	Chapter 2 introduced the plan-protect respond cycle and covered the planning phase.
-	Chapters 3 through 9 will cover the protection phase.
-	Chapter 3 introduces cryptography, which is important in itself and which is used in many other protections.
